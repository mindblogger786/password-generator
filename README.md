# Password Generator
This project is a simple password generator implemented using JavaScript. It provides a user interface where users can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is displayed to the user upon clicking the "Generate Password" button.

## Features
- **Length Selection**: Users can choose the length of the password (between 8 to 16 characters).
- **Character Selection**: Users can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the generated password.
- **Random Generation**: Passwords are randomly generated based on user preferences.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard for immediate use.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the structure and basic elements of the user interface.
- CSS: Styles the HTML elements for a more visually appealing experience.
- JavaScript: Handles the logic for generating passwords based on user input and interacts with the DOM to update the interface.

   - Use the slider to select the desired password length.
   - Check or uncheck the checkboxes to include or exclude types of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters).
3. **Generating a Password**: Click the "Generate Password" button.
4. **Copying Password**: Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated password.
